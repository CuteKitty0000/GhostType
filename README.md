# GhostType

GhostType is a versatile application designed to automate typing tasks on various platforms, including the Amypo coding portal. By leveraging a vulnerability in the portal's security measures, GhostType can simulate human-like typing behavior, bypassing detection mechanisms.

## Exploited Vulnerability:
1. **Detection Evasion**: Amypo monitors typing speed and patterns, detecting automated inputs. GhostType bypasses this detection by employing random typing speeds and mimicking human typing behavior using the keyboard library.

## Features
- Simulates human-like typing speed to evade detection.
- Listens for a keyword trigger to initiate typing.
- Supports typing of both regular text and code snippets.

## Usage
1. Run the `GhostType.exe` file.
2. Enter the desired text or code snippet into the provided text area.
3. Click the "Start Listening" button.
4. Enter the keyword trigger when prompted.
5. Navigate to the Amypo coding portal or desired text field.
6. Type the keyword trigger to initiate automated typing.
